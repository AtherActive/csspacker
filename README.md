# csspacker
Packs a bunch of smaller CSS files together from 1 folder.

## How does it work?
Simple, run it in the CMD!

```
// Assuming you are in the working dir
./pack.exe [folder path^]  [targetdir] [filename, DO NOT ADD .CSS]

// When using it from path
pack.exe [folder path^]  [targetdir] [filename, DO NOT ADD .CSS]
```
^ If you are selecting a folder from your WORKING dir (that is also inside of that dir) use `./`
